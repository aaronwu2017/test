# Software Requirement Specification 


## Problem Statement: A few sentences to describe the problem you are trying to solve, i.e., justify why this software is needed.

Every month, about 200 goods are posted to the WeChat group. This number is still limited by the number of people in the WeChat group. There are only 500 people in one wechat group at most. 

There are many problems with using WeChat as an online marketplace.
* Many people don't want to add so many people on wechat.
* After a seller/buyer posts something in the WeChat group, in a few days people may not know that she has posted these things
* a lack of classification. Sometimes you only want to buy something when you see it, and sometimes you just want to buy something that is free. Sometimes you donâ€™t know what others intended to sell, so you may not ask.
* There are still many problems (transaction records, evaluations of buyers and sellers, searches, etc.), because WeChat groups are not designed for buying and selling.

## Software Architecture



Client Side:
Client.js: Develop custom React components for data manipulations and to display data in UI
login.js: implement OpenID Connect Client to login with Google.

Server Side:
server.java: Create an java springboot server that interacts with MySQL and Create Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
item.java: Built relational (MySQL) database to capture event data 
Recommendation.java:   Recommendation Algorithm
User A likes Item A, Item C. User B likes Item B. User C likes Item A, Item C, Item D.
=> User A shares similar preference as User C compared to User B. User C also likes Item D=> User A may like Item D. 
Using Model-View Controller software design pattern.
